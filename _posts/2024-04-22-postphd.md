I am excited to announce that this summer, I will be working as an intern for [Turing Medical](https://turingmedical.com/), developing neuroimaging-based software solutions for clinicians.

Then, beginning in August, I will begin a Postdoctoral Fellowship in the [Penn Lifespan Informatics and Neuroimaging Center](https://www.pennlinc.io/), led by Ted Satterthwaite! I will be funded by an NIMH T32, and will also be a ReproNim/INCF Reproducible Neuroimaging Fellow.

I will be at OHBM 2024 and possibly Flux 2024, if anyone would want to connect there!

I am an incoming postdoctoral fellow at the [Penn Lifespan Informatics and Neuroimaging Center](https://www.pennlinc.io/), led by Dr. Ted Satterthwaite. I am recent graduate of the [Harvard / MIT Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology (SHBT)](https://shbtphd.hms.harvard.edu/). My research interests broadly revolve around using multimodal neuroimaging tecnhiques to uncover relationships between brain structure, function, and behavior, and to explore these associations in neurodevelopmental, neurospychiatric, and learning disorders. In my graduate work with Dr. John Gabrieli, I specifically focused on neural systems supporting language and reading. Before starting my doctorate I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) and Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania in May of 2017 and 2018, respectively. My [master's thesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016502701930278X?casa_token=1_SJIWQAv6sAAAAA:nF77yfrJ6rNv0CdVLB4u2qGQ6OYRKWzMYR86algGY9CoIHNF6ys49GZdmSg2Hgki38Ejo60o1rjG), advised by Dr. Michael Kahana, focused on the utility of common intracranial EEG preprocessing methods when classifiying neural data. Between Penn and Harvard, I was a research coordinator in the Laboratory for NeuroImaging of Coma and Consciousness led by Dr. Brian Edlow, examining how neural biometrics obtained in the ICU could predict recovery outcomes for patients with disorders of consciousness from traumatic brain injuries. Outside of research I enjoy running, cooking, and playing music. I am a jazz percussionist (primarily vibraphone) and pianist, and perform with the MIT Jazz Combos.
